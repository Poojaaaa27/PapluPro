## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey sophistication and focus. This hue mirrors the intellectual and strategic nature of the card game.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF) creates a soft and clean backdrop for content, while keeping a desaturated relation to the primary.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#8A2BE2) for interactive elements and highlights, offering visual interest.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, complemented by 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text to offer an engaging and classic look with high readability.
- Use custom, minimalist icons to represent game actions and statuses (e.g., cards, points, win/loss).
- Implement a modern, clean dashboard with clearly defined sections (Menu, Game, Master, Points) accessible via tabs or a navigation bar.
- Subtle animations and transitions when navigating between sections, updating scores, or triggering alerts.
